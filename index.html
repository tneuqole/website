Some we are born with, some we cause ourselves, other happen out of our control. Often a problem can become an excuse that perpetuates further problems. We think to ourselves, if only I didn&rsquo;t have to deal with this, I could make progress on that project. Once this is over, I&rsquo;ll start going to the gym.</p></div></section><section class=my-3><div class="flex justify-between items-center"><h1 class="text-2xl font-medium m-0"><a href=/posts/seneca_letter_7/ class="text-blue hover:text-lavender">Seneca Letter 7</a></h1><div class="text-right text-base text-subtext-0"><time datetime=2024-10-20T00:00:00+00:00>Oct 20, 2024</time></div></div><div class="mt-3 mb-9 overflow-clip text-lg"><p>Humans are easily influenced. If you think yourself immune, you are either lacking self-awareness or are in denial. This is not to say that influence is inherently bad. It can be a nurturing or destructive force, depending on the source.</p><p>Take care with who and what you let enter your life. The friends we make, the media we consume, and the communities we join all create the environment of which we are the product. You must have a strong set of beliefs and principles that enable you to judge whether an influence is healthy or not. If the answer is no, ruthlessly cut it out of your life. The bad has no right to your time.</p></div></section><section class=my-3><div class="flex justify-between items-center"><h1 class="text-2xl font-medium m-0"><a href=/posts/seneca_letter_6/ class="text-blue hover:text-lavender">Seneca Letter 6</a></h1><div class="text-right text-base text-subtext-0"><time datetime=2024-09-28T00:00:00+00:00>Sep 28, 2024</time></div></div><div class="mt-3 mb-9 overflow-clip text-lg"><p>Improving oneself is a lifelong endeavor. Do not despair at this realization, embrace it.
Your work is a noble one; you should give thanks that it will always be with you.
For it is not the destination that is significant but the journey. After all, death is the final destination for everyone.</p><p>Seek a friend, or perhaps a mentor, to join you on your journey. Humans are social creatures. Much is left
unspoken, meaning much is learned by observation. There is an insight to be gained from even a novice.
Every individual is a concoction of unique experiences and perspectives. The same sight appears differently
when seen through two pairs of eyes.</p></div></section><section class=my-3><div class="flex justify-between items-center"><h1 class="text-2xl font-medium m-0"><a href=/posts/seneca_letter_5/ class="text-blue hover:text-lavender">Seneca Letter 5</a></h1><div class="text-right text-base text-subtext-0"><time datetime=2024-09-03T00:00:00+00:00>Sep 3, 2024</time></div></div><div class="mt-3 mb-9 overflow-clip text-lg"><p>Walk the middle path. The key to life lies in avoiding extremes. There is no enlightenment to be found in starvation, nor in indulgence. Do not
use philosophy as an excuse for degeneracy. Staking your happiness on worldly possessions and subjecting yourself to poverty lead to the same
destination. As Seneca says, our aim is to live in accordance with Nature. Live as a human being. Participate in society. Do not reject the world,
engage with it.</p></div></section><div class="flex flex-row justify-between items-center mt-5"><div class=flex-1></div><div class="flex-1 text-center text-subtext-0">Page 1 of 2</div><a href=/page/2/ class="flex-1 text-right text-blue hover:text-lavender">Older Posts &rarr;</a></div></main><footer class="mt-10 mb-10 text-center text-lg"><p>© Copyright 2025.
