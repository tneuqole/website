I&amp;rsquo;m going to use this site to record some of my thoughts, and hopefully improve my writing skills along the way. For starters, I&amp;rsquo;ve been following this book club and slowly reading Seneca&amp;rsquo;s Letters on Ethics, writing a response to each one. If I feel that there&amp;rsquo;s any insight in my writings, I&amp;rsquo;ll share them here. I also plan to talk about different self improvement topics, and maybe the occasional technical subject.</description></item></channel></rss>
