Walk the middle path. The key to life lies in avoiding extremes. There is no enlightenment to be found in starvation, nor in indulgence. Do not
use philosophy as an excuse for degeneracy. Staking your happiness on worldly possessions and subjecting yourself to poverty lead to the same
destination. As Seneca says, our aim is to live in accordance with Nature. Live as a human being. Participate in society. Do not reject the world,
engage with it.

Always remember that fear follows hope from close behind. Yet, avoiding emotion is a sign of weakness. Allow yourself to feel, but let your actions
be dictated by reason. Your work is to better yourself. Be rich on the inside, and modest without.

The present is an abundance of peace. Happiness is fleeting, as is sorrow. Acknowledge this, and pay attention to what is happening right now.
Time will stop slipping through your fingers, and you will realize you have a lot to be grateful for. Rejoice that you are alive, and death will
hold no power over you. What you are experiencing now does not invalidate the past, nor determine the future. It simply is.

Go forth, and live according to your purpose. It's a beautiful thing. Life is truly profound.
