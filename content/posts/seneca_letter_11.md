"If wisdom could erase all defects, it would have nature herself under its charge."

All of us have problems. Some we are born with, some we cause ourselves, other happen out of our control. Often a problem can become an excuse that perpetuates further problems. We think to ourselves, if only I didn't have to deal with this, I could make progress on that project. Once this is over, I'll start going to the gym.

Listen carefully. There is no end. There will never be an end. It's like an infinite ladder; the instant you reach one rung there is yet another above you. Time flows onward impervious to your struggles. How long will you push aside the work you truly want to do? No matter how much you improve yourself, there will always be some issue that requires your attention. You can let this cripple you, or you can set yourself free.

Fighting against nature is a futile endeavor. You cannot prevent the twists and turns of life, but they do not have to hold dominion over your mind. Engage the day to day with open arms and focus only on what you can control. The rest will run its course.
