Improving oneself is a lifelong endeavor. Do not despair at this realization, embrace it.
Your work is a noble one; you should give thanks that it will always be with you.
For it is not the destination that is significant but the journey. After all, death is the final destination for everyone.

Seek a friend, or perhaps a mentor, to join you on your journey. Humans are social creatures. Much is left
unspoken, meaning much is learned by observation. There is an insight to be gained from even a novice.
Every individual is a concoction of unique experiences and perspectives. The same sight appears differently
when seen through two pairs of eyes.

People are at their best when collaborating. Look for true friendships that are mutually beneficial, and you will
find your life enriched.
