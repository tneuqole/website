Circumstances change, but human nature does not. We still act selfishly, driven by ego. We don't
pay attention to ourselves or the present moment. We act mindlessly, all the while death approaches
indiscriminately. We worry about the future and wallow in sadness about the past. We don't appreciate
what we have, and cry when it's gone.

What is there to be afraid of? Once death arrives, pain and fear will be no more. Why stain the
present moment with anxiety of something you have no control over? Surrender, accept, and look
within. There is peace and joy to be found in what you have right now.
