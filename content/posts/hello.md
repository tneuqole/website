Welcome to this hidden corner of the internet. I'm going to use this site to record some of my thoughts, and hopefully improve my writing skills along
the way. For starters, I've been following this [book club](https://www.youtube.com/@acceptingtheuniverse) and slowly reading Seneca's _Letters
on Ethics_, writing a response to each one. If I feel that there's any insight in my writings, I'll share them here. I also plan to talk about
different self improvement topics, and maybe the occasional technical subject.

I doubt many people will read this, and if it does become popular I'm sure it will take considerable effort and time. The point of it all is
to start creating something. If you don't start, you'll never improve. For those of you who come across this, I hope you find something of value.
