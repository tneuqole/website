We still act selfishly, driven by ego. We don&amp;rsquo;t pay attention to ourselves or the present moment. We act mindlessly, all the while death approaches indiscriminately. We worry about the future and wallow in sadness about the past. We don&amp;rsquo;t appreciate what we have, and cry when it&amp;rsquo;s gone.
What is there to be afraid of? Once death arrives, pain and fear will be no more.</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>https://tneuqole.com/posts/hello/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tneuqole.com/posts/hello/</guid><description>Welcome to this hidden corner of the internet. I&amp;rsquo;m going to use this site to record some of my thoughts, and hopefully improve my writing skills along the way. For starters, I&amp;rsquo;ve been following this book club and slowly reading Seneca&amp;rsquo;s Letters on Ethics, writing a response to each one. If I feel that there&amp;rsquo;s any insight in my writings, I&amp;rsquo;ll share them here. I also plan to talk about different self improvement topics, and maybe the occasional technical subject.</description></item></channel></rss>
