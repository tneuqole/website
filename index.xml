The key to life lies in avoiding extremes. There is no enlightenment to be found in starvation, nor in indulgence. Do not
use philosophy as an excuse for degeneracy. Staking your happiness on worldly possessions and subjecting yourself to poverty lead to the same
destination. As Seneca says, our aim is to live in accordance with Nature. Live as a human being. Participate in society. Do not reject the world,
engage with it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Seneca Letter 4</title><link>https://tneuqole.com/posts/seneca_letter_4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tneuqole.com/posts/seneca_letter_4/</guid><description>&lt;p>Circumstances change, but human nature does not. We still act selfishly, driven by ego. We don&amp;rsquo;t
pay attention to ourselves or the present moment. We act mindlessly, all the while death approaches
indiscriminately. We worry about the future and wallow in sadness about the past. We don&amp;rsquo;t appreciate
what we have, and cry when it&amp;rsquo;s gone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is there to be afraid of? Once death arrives, pain and fear will be no more. Why stain the
present moment with anxiety of something you have no control over? Surrender, accept, and look
within. There is peace and joy to be found in what you have right now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>https://tneuqole.com/posts/hello/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tneuqole.com/posts/hello/</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome to this hidden corner of the internet. I&amp;rsquo;m going to use this site to record some of my thoughts, and hopefully improve my writing skills along
the way. For starters, I&amp;rsquo;ve been following this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@acceptingtheuniverse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book club&lt;/a> and slowly reading Seneca&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Letters
on Ethics&lt;/em>, writing a response to each one. If I feel that there&amp;rsquo;s any insight in my writings, I&amp;rsquo;ll share them here. I also plan to talk about
different self improvement topics, and maybe the occasional technical subject.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
